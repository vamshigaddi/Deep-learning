Customer Churn Prediction

Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn, which is a critical challenge for businesses in various industries. Customer churn, or customer attrition, occurs when customers discontinue their business relationship with a company. It is essential to identify and address the factors leading to churn to retain valuable customers and reduce revenue loss.

In this project, we leverage machine learning to build a customer churn prediction model. By analyzing historical customer data, we aim to predict which customers are likely to churn and take proactive measures to retain them.

Features
Data Collection: We gathered historical customer data that includes various attributes such as customer demographics, transaction history, and customer service interactions.

Data Preprocessing: We cleaned and transformed the data to make it suitable for model training. This involved handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numeric attributes.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We conducted EDA to gain insights into the data. This helped us identify patterns, correlations, and potential predictors of churn.

Machine Learning Models: We trained and evaluated various machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, to predict customer churn.

Model Evaluation: We assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall. 

Results
Our best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 81% and a recall of 80%, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying customers at risk of churn. The insights from this project can be used to develop targeted retention strategies and improve customer satisfaction.
